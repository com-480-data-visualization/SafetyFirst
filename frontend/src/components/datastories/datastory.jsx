                Chicago is an incredible place to begin your academic journey ‚Äî packed with music, museums, food, and vibrant neighborhoods.
                But as with any large urban environment, it‚Äôs important to understand the risks that come with city living,

            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Many students navigate unfamiliar streets, use public transportation late at night, and live in off-campus housing ‚Äî all of which come with specific safety concerns.
