            Street Crime in Chicago: A Tourist's Perspective
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            Chicago is a vibrant city full of history, architecture, food, and music ‚Äî but like many large urban centers, it also faces challenges with street crime.
            While the city has made efforts to improve safety, tourists can still be vulnerable to certain types of crime, especially in crowded and popular areas.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Theft & Pickpocketing:</strong> Especially common in high-foot-traffic areas like Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, and CTA stations.</li>
            <li><strong>Robbery:</strong> Tourists have been targeted for their phones, cameras, and bags ‚Äî particularly when distracted or alone at night.</li>
            <li><strong>Assaults & Muggings:</strong> Though less frequent, incidents of physical assault or mugging do occur near popular attractions and in poorly lit areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Scams & Fraud:</strong> Fake ticket sellers, unofficial tour guides, and credit card scams can also target unsuspecting travelers.</li>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Recent headlines suggest a decline in violent crime across U.S. cities, including Chicago. Reports indicate that homicide rates and other violent crimes decreased in many U.S. cities compared to 2023.

            However, public perception doesn't always align with these statistics. Factors such as increased media coverage and social media discussions contribute to a heightened sense of insecurity among residents and visitors.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            While certain crime categories have seen reductions, others, like sexual assaults and aggravated assaults, have experienced increases in several major cities.
